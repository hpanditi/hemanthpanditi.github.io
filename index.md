### Technical Background: I was briefly part of a web-development bootcamp that mainly focused on Javascript. I also took a "programming logic" course that dealt with python. I was also briefly taking a self-paced online class for JAVA for several weeks.

### Project Description: Our team, NoIdea, is currently attempting to build a static code analysis tool. The purpose of this tool is to serve as a conglomeration of different tools in order to be more effective. This tool will scan the repository for errors/bugs and generate a report at the end. This will then be used to give the software developer insight as to what errors need to be fixed.
